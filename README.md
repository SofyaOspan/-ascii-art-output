## üßê About <a name="about"></a>

This is a Go program that can display ASCII art banners in the terminal. The user can choose from different banner styles, and the program will display a banner with the given text. The program takes two arguments: a string of text to display in the banner and the name of the banner style to use. The banner styles are defined in separate template files, and the program reads the templates from the file system.

The goal of this project is to learn about the following:

- Go file system (fs) API
- Data manipulation

### Prerequisites

- ![VSCode](https://skillicons.com/api/icons/vscode.svg) [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- ![Go](https://skillicons.com/api/icons/go.svg) [Go](https://golang.org) 1.20 or higher

### Installing

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The program can be run with the following command:


``Usage: go run . [OPTION] [STRING] [BANNER]``
``EX: go run . --output=<fileName.txt> something standard``


- `[OPTION]` is the flag for specifying the output file. It must be in the format `--output=<fileName.txt>`, where `--output` is the flag and `<fileName.txt>` is the desired file name.
- `[STRING]` is the text to display in the banner.
- `[BANNER]` is the name of the banner style to use.

If there are other ASCII-art optional projects implemented, the program should accept other correctly formatted `[OPTION]` and/or `[BANNER]`. Additionally, the program must still be able to run with a single `[STRING]` argument.
